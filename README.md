## Project Overview
This is a really simple project that allows you to find activities using [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com) created using `vite` along with `react` and `typescript + swc`. The idea of this project was to learn the following libraries and technologies to further improve my frontend development skills and develop stronger testing and debugging skills:

- StoryBook
- React Testing Library
- Vitest
- clsx
- tailwind-merge
